                    <p>At the Turts&Torts, we are concerned with protecting your privacy. We use the information that we gather from you to provide a more personalized approach to your shopping experience. If you are a subscriber to our newsletter we may also use it inform you of special offers that we think you will appreciate. Rest assured that you will never be bombarded by emails. Turts&Torts will never rent, sell or trade any of your personal information.</p>
                    <p>When registering with Turts&Torts, we will ask for some contact information, such as your name and email address. We will use the customer contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company. If you do not wish to receive future mailing, see the "Newsletter Unsubscribe" section below.</p>
                    <p>Occasionally you will provide us with information that doesn't reveal your personal identity. For instance, whether you are interested in Turtles or Tortoises? We may use this kind of information for further perspective and personalization purposes. This information may also be used for other internal reasons (for example, we might offer promotional sales for Tortoise products specifically to Tortoise owners), but we do not connect it to any name, address or other personal identifying information. This allows us to offer you a more customized experience without jeopardizing or compromising your privacy.</p>
                    <p>Please note that nowhere on the website do we knowingly collect contact information or financial information from anyone under the age of 18.</p>
